# Customer Churn Prediction Using ANN

## Project Description
This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict **customer churn** for a company. The model classifies whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) or stay based on their behavioral and demographic data. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning for business analytics and decision-making.

## Features
- Predicts customer churn with high accuracy.
- Handles pre-processing of data (e.g., encoding categorical variables, feature scaling).
- Uses TensorFlow/Keras for building the ANN model.
- Provides confusion matrix and performance metrics for evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib 
- **IDE:** VS Code
